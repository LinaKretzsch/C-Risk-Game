The C++ Risk Game is a project created in a team of 5 within the scope of a C++ course I took at Concordia in 2020. All our team members developed great C++ skills and learned to use GIT in order to collaborate seamlessly. The project was split into 3 assignments and the work was split up per individual. Although the development was sequential at times, my team's excellent communication skills enabled us to work through each assignment seamlessly. I wrote the player class, half of the game setup phase and contributed to the player strategies. Revising my teammates pull requests on GIT was just as important as writing my own code.
The game's objective is to conquer all the territories of a map by deploying armies that are assigned to every player each turn. One user can play and chose if the other players are played by the computer or their choices entered manually. There is no GUI for this game since the focus was on creating the structural component, but the game can be played using the console.
